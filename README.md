All images in the final report document were generated from this Jupyter notebook, but not all images are present in this file. The same code block might be rerun several times
to generate different images.

ChatGPT 5.1, provided by the Harvard University, was used during the writing of this code. Here are a list of things that it did:
- Provided relevant functions from matplotlib, and generated structure for making 3D graphs and 2D contours.
- Debug infinite loops in function line_search and zoom. The "counter" was included to cutoff potential infinite loops.
- Generate pseudocodes for the zoom function.

Some uncleaned code blocks might be left behind for debugging purposes and might not be useful at all.
